# My OBS Settings

This is my backed up OBS settings.

## Where are they?

To find yours, in OBS go to: File>Show Settings Folder.

It will open in the settings folder, go back one directory level and
backup `obs-studio`.

```bash
# Linux
/home/scott/.config/obs-studio
# Windows
C:\Users\scott\AppData\Roaming\obs-studio
```

This is my settings for my machine, yours will probably differ.
